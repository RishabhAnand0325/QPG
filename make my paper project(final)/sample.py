base_text= """In the heart of the quaint village of Eldermere, a mysterious tree stood tall in the town square. Its 
gnarled branches bore fruits that resembled pears, but with an unusual twist: they seemed to shimmer 
with a golden hue. The villagers affectionately named it the "Shakespear" tree, believing it held magical 
properties. 
Legend had it that anyone who tasted a Shakespear would gain a glimpse into their future. Curiosity 
spread like wildfire, and soon, villagers flocked to the tree, eager for a taste of destiny. Young Emma, a 
spirited girl with dreams of becoming a writer, felt an undeniable pull toward the shimmering fruit. 
One crisp autumn morning, she approached the tree, heart racing. With a deep breath, she plucked a 
Shakespear and took a bite. Instantly, a whirlwind of visions enveloped her. She saw herself standing on a 
grand stage, the applause of a thousand voices echoing in her ears. In another glimpse, she wandered 
through enchanted forests, her stories coming to life. 
Determined to fulfill these dreams, Emma spent every spare moment writing. The villagers, inspired by 
her passion, began sharing their own tales. The square buzzed with creativity, and soon, Eldermere 
became a hub of storytelling. 
As the seasons changed, Emmaâ€™s words took flight. She published her first book, a collection of 
enchanting stories, and it captured the hearts of many beyond Eldermere. The Shakespear tree 
continued to stand, its golden pears glimmering, a reminder that dreams, when nurtured, could blossom 
into reality. 
And so, in the embrace of magic and creativity, the legacy of the Shakespear lived on, inspiring 
generations to reach for their dreams. """
